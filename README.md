### Publication REpository Semantic System

Publication management systems can be instrumental in disseminating research results across academia and industry, by providing facilities for uploading, editing and searching for publications. Usually, these systems can be used by individuals to assist them in their research or by organizations to help them classify and promote their publication items.

**PRESS** is an open-source publication system that exploits semantic technologies in order to cover the needs of both individuals and organizations. Thus, it supports fast data entry, advanced query capabilities and integration with other systems or datasets.
